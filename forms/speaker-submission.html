Submit button. The method attribute can be either post or get, both of which
define how the form is submitted to the backend server.  -->

        sent to the backend server. The name attribute defines the name of this
        variable, and the value is whatever the user entered into the text field.
        Note that you can pre-populate this value by adding a value attribute to
        an <input/> element. -->
